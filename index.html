            #2 JSON Object literal and JS Object Literal Differencess
        </h2>
     <ul>
        <p>Syntax:With JS Object literals, functions and expression can be expressed as values while JSON data types can be expressed as values.</p>
        <p>Use Case:JS Object Literals are used to creat complex objects that have nested functions structures while JSON object literals are used to share data between systems like APIs.</p>
        <p>Data Types:JS object literals support all of the data types in JS while JSON object literals can only be strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and arrays.</p>
        <p></p>
     </ul>
